# Binance API


## Description
This is a project to interact with the Binance REST API to retrieve a series of financial data, access account details and assets, and send buy/sell orders. The repository includes several standard indicators to use along with the financial data from the Binance.US Exchange.


## Getting Started
* Generate a public and private key with Binance.US
* Create a config.py file, and initialize __api_k__ to public key and __api_s__ to secret key
* The main.py file contains how and what parameters are passed in for each GET/POST method, and can be modified to fit your trading strategy and risk tolerance.
* Set the repository to the current working directory, eg., /Github/BinanceAPI>
* Run the main.py in the IDE or the terminal using:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
